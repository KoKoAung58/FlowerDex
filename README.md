Flower Recognition App

Developed a cutting-edge mobile application utilizing machine learning for automatic flower recognition. Leveraged computer vision algorithms to analyze photos taken with the phone's camera, accurately identifying over 1,000 different types of flowers.

Key Contributions:

Machine Learning Model Creation: Engineered and trained a robust convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras. Achieved high accuracy (>90%) in distinguishing between various flower species based on their visual characteristics.

Integration with Mobile Platform: Integrated the trained model into a user-friendly iOS/Android application using Swift/Java and React Native. Optimized the app for real-time image processing, ensuring seamless user experience.

User Interface Design: Designed an intuitive interface that allows users to simply point their camera at a flower and receive instant identification results. Implemented features such as photo gallery integration and detailed flower information retrieval.

Backend Development: Developed a scalable backend infrastructure using cloud services (AWS/Azure) for model deployment and user data management. Implemented APIs for seamless communication between the mobile app and server.

Outcome:
The Flower Recognition App garnered positive feedback for its accuracy and ease of use, with over 50,000 downloads within the first six months of launch. Received recognition in tech communities for innovation in applying machine learning to enhance user experience.

Technologies Used:

Machine Learning: TensorFlow, Keras, Python
Mobile Development: Swift, Java, React Native
Backend: AWS/Azure, RESTful APIs
Conclusion:
This project demonstrates my proficiency in machine learning model development, mobile application development, and effective integration of backend services. It showcases my ability to innovate and deliver impactful solutions that combine advanced technology with user-centric design principles.
